# whale_identification
This was my first project on traditional machine learning and opencv in this project
also i have tried to extract image features using opencv and then i have applied some model from sklearn
i have achieved decent accuracy with traditional machine learning and 
at the end i have tried to implement deep learning model not siamese but just some small model in keras 
beware these files are a bit unstructured ;)
